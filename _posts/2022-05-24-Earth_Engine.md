In this blog post, I show two usecases of the Google Earth Engine for Economic research.

## What is the Google Earth Engine?
Google's Earth Engine is a powerful tool to process large amounts of satellite data. <br>
Common uses include calculating nightlights, elevation, or population statistics. 

Some advantages of the Earth Engine:
<li> Large number of satellite products directly available on Google's Servers </li>
<li> All calculations are run in the cloud </li>

You can check out a number of highlighted case studies directly at \href{https://earthengine.google.com/case_studies/}. 
To use the Earth Engine by yourself, you are required to register at https://signup.earthengine.google.com/.
