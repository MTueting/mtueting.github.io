    <h2> About me </h2>
    <p> I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at the <a href="https://www.unisg.ch/en/">University of St.Gallen</a>, Switzerland. My research covers topics in Economic Geography and International Trade with a focus on climate change and developing countries. </p>
    <p> From September 23 through June 24, I am visiting <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/adamstoreygard">Adam Storeygard</a> at Tufts. </p>
    <p> I will be on the academic job market in 25/26. </p>

            <p>This paper harmonizes individual-level data on labor supply for 54 countries to document how firm size and the skill intensity of employment by firm size vary across countries. First, it finds that the share of employment in large firms in high-income countries is more than three times larger than in low-income countries. Second, it shows that across countries, employees of large firms are more skilled than those of small firms. Third, it documents that lower skill endowments in low-income countries affect employment in firms of different sizes asymmetrically: the skill intensity of employment is much lower in small firms in low-income countries than in high-income countries but only slightly lower in large firms. This evidence suggests that large firms rely particularly strongly on employing high-skill workers so that the low skill endowment of low-income countries limits the size of firms in these countries.</p>

            <p>In this paper, we estimate the (deep) elasticity of intra-national trade costs with respect to language differences in Africa. Our proposed estimation strategy does not require bilateral trade data on the sub-national level but recovers the elasticity non-linearly from observed agglomeration changes and changes in the African transportation network between 1970 and 2015 using a market access approach. </p>
