<br> 
<p> I am a Econ Ph.D. student at the University of St.Gallen, Switzerland. <br>
My research is in the fields of economic geography, regional economics, and conflict with a focus on developing countries. </p>

<p> I am passionate about the spatial distribution of economic activity and people. </p>

<p> As a byproduct of my focus on developing countries, I often rely on satellite imagery or historic maps and constantly develop tools for spatial data generation or analysis. <br>
In a recent research project, I trained a Convolutional Neural Network to automize the digitization of historic road maps. </p>
